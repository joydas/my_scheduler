# Task Scheduling Web App

A **Flask-based web application** that reads **resource** and **work list** data from an Excel file, displays the **initial state**, and then runs a **task scheduling algorithm** to produce an **optimized assignment**. The scheduling logic considers **leave schedules**, **effort durations**, and skips **weekends** automatically.
